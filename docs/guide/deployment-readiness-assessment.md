# Deployment Readiness Assessment — mind-cli

> **Date**: 2026-03-13 (final)
> **Assessor**: Automated
> **CLI Version**: v0.3.1
> **Go Version**: go1.26.1
> **Tag**: `v0.3.1` pushed to `origin` (supersedes v0.3.0 which lacked B3 fix)

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Verdict: PASS — 0 blockers, 2 caveats, 1 recommendation**

The CLI builds, all 18 test packages pass (plus 1 root package with no test files), and all commands execute without crashing. The v0.3.1 tag is pushed to GitHub and `go install github.com/jf-ferraz/mind-cli@v0.3.1` works. Global commands (`config`, `registry`, `framework install/status`) work correctly outside a project directory. Two caveats remain: the `go install` binary is named `mind-cli` (not `mind`), and version injection requires the Makefile. Both are documented.

---

## 1 — Build & Distribution Readiness

| Check | Verdict | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `go build -o mind .` | **PASS** | Builds cleanly via `make build` |
| `go install github.com/jf-ferraz/mind-cli@v0.3.1` | **PASS** | Installs successfully; binary named `mind-cli` (documented caveat) |
| `go test ./...` | **PASS** | 18/18 packages pass (69 test files); root package has no tests |
| Version injection via ldflags | **PASS** | `make build` and `make install` inject version, commit SHA, and build date |
| Makefile | **PASS** | Targets: `build`, `install`, `test`, `vet`, `clean`, `help` |

### Binary Name Caveat

`go install github.com/jf-ferraz/mind-cli@v0.3.1` produces `~/go/bin/mind-cli`, but the CLI self-identifies as `mind` and all documentation refers to `mind`. The README documents both install paths:

1. **`make install`** — produces `mind` in `$GOPATH/bin` with version injection
2. **`go install @v0.3.1`** — produces `mind-cli`; tester can symlink: `ln -s ~/go/bin/mind-cli ~/go/bin/mind`

---

## 2 — Repository Readiness

| Check | Verdict | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| GitHub remote configured | **PASS** | `origin → https://github.com/jf-ferraz/mind-cli.git` |
| Repo publicly accessible | **PASS** | `git ls-remote` succeeds without auth |
| `mind` (framework) repo accessible | **PASS** | `https://github.com/jf-ferraz/mind.git` also public |
| Main branch up to date | **PASS** | `origin/main` at v0.3.1 tag |
| v0.3.1 tag pushed | **PASS** | `go install @v0.3.1` resolves correctly (includes all fixes) |
| `.gitignore` coverage | **PASS** | `/mind` (build output), `.mind/`, `.claude/`, `archive/`, `prompt.txt` all covered |
| No binary in working tree | **PASS** | Removed via `make clean` |
| Go dependencies | **PASS** | Not vendored; `go.sum` present; `go install @v0.3.1` fetches cleanly |
| Docs tracked | **PASS** | `docs/guide/end-to-end-walkthrough.md` and `deployment-readiness-assessment.md` both committed |
| LICENSE | **PASS** | MIT license file present and tracked |
| Stale local branches | **NOTE** | 16 local branches from earlier phases — no impact on testers or contributors (remote only has `main`) |

---

## 3 — Installation Documentation

| Check | Verdict | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| README.md install section | **PASS** | Quick Start for Testers (7 steps), build from source, `go install` |
| End-to-end walkthrough | **PASS** | `docs/guide/end-to-end-walkthrough.md` — 1,538 lines, 17 sections |
| Walkthrough: install flow | **PASS** | Three install options documented with clear trade-offs |
| Walkthrough: global setup | **PASS** | Clone mind repo → `framework install --source` → verify |
| Prerequisites | **PASS** | README and walkthrough both state Go 1.24+ (matches `go.mod` requirement of 1.24.2) |
| Platform support | **NOTE** | Linux/macOS/WSL documented. No Windows native guidance. |
| Shell completion | **PASS** | Documented for bash/zsh/fish |

---

## 4 — Global Configuration Bootstrap

| Check | Verdict | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `framework install --source <path>` | **PASS** | Works correctly from any directory; copies 145 artifacts to `~/.config/mind/` |
| `config show` without project | **PASS** | Works from any directory |
| `registry list` without project | **PASS** | Works from any directory |
| `framework status` without project | **PASS** | Works from any directory |
| Framework requires second repo clone | **NOTE** | Tester must clone `github.com/jf-ferraz/mind.git` separately — documented in README Quick Start |
| `config.toml` auto-created | **PASS** | Created on first access with sensible defaults |
| `projects.toml` auto-created | **PASS** | Created when `registry add` is first called |
| `framework.lock` written | **PASS** | SHA-256 checksums, version, source path all recorded |

Global commands correctly exempt from project requirement via `requiresProject()` in `cmd/root.go:124`: `config`, `registry`, `framework install`, and `framework status` all work outside a project directory.

> **Note**: This was **blocker B3** in the original assessment. At v0.3.0 (`aad8788`), `requiresProject()` only exempted `version`, `help`, `init`, `completion`, `tui`, `serve`, and `mind`. The fix adding `config`, `registry`, and `framework install/status` exemptions was delivered in commit `a141ba2`.

---

## 5 — First-Run Experience

| Check | Verdict | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `mind init` on empty dir | **PASS** | Creates `mind.toml`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `docs/` with 5 zones, 8 stub files |
| `mind status` on fresh project | **PASS** | Shows health dashboard, warns about stubs, exits 1 (correct) |
| `mind doctor` on fresh project | **PASS** | 11 pass, 0 fail, 7 warnings — all actionable |
| `mind check all` on fresh project | **PASS** | 40 pass, 0 fail, 1 warning (stubs) |
| Error message for non-project dir | **PASS** | "not a Mind project (no .mind/ directory found)" with exit code 3 |
| `mind framework materialize` | **PASS** | Copies 145 artifacts from global to project `.mind/` |
| `mind framework update` | **PASS** | Detects no changes, reports "already up to date" |
| `mind framework diff` | **PASS** | Shows differences between project and global |
| `create brief` (interactive) | **PASS** | Launches interactive prompt — works, requires TTY |

## 7 — Caveats and Recommendations

### CAVEATS (known, documented, not blocking)

| # | Issue | Mitigation |
|---|-------|------------|
| C1 | `go install` produces binary named `mind-cli` | README documents both install paths; `make install` produces `mind` |
| C2 | `go install` cannot inject version via ldflags | README documents `make build`/`make install` for version injection |

### RECOMMENDATION

| # | Improvement | Priority |
|---|-------------|----------|
| R1 | Clean up 16 stale local branches | Low — no impact on testers, remote only has `main` |

---

## Revision History

| Rev | Commit | Date | Changes |
|-----|--------|------|---------|
| v1 | `c8cd0ff` | 2026-03-13 | Original assessment — verdict: CONDITIONAL PASS, 3 blockers (B1: unpushed commits, B2: binary name mismatch, B3: global commands require project), 6 warnings |
| v2 | `d91cf41` | 2026-03-13 | Revised to reflect post-fix state — but incorrectly presented B3 as never having existed |
| v3 | `7dc55c9` | 2026-03-13 | Corrected attribution: B3 was a genuine blocker at v0.3.0 fixed by `a141ba2`; test count corrected to 18 (not 19); revision history added |
| v4 | (this) | 2026-03-13 | Cut v0.3.1 tag at HEAD (v0.3.0 tag did not include B3 fix); updated all doc references from v0.3.0 → v0.3.1 |

### What each commit delivered

- **`aad8788` (v0.3.0)**: Makefile, README rewrite, LICENSE, end-to-end walkthrough, docs/guide/ tracked. Resolved B1 (unpushed commits) and W1 (untracked docs).
- **`a141ba2`**: `requiresProject()` exemptions for config/registry/framework install+status, nil guards in framework.go, Makefile install target fix, README rename instructions. Resolved B2 (binary name) and B3 (global commands).
